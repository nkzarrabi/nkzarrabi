ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Nikou Zarrabi

ðŸŒŸ About Me

Iâ€™m a DevOps Engineer, Software Developer, and a lifelong problem solver with a curiosity for understanding how things work and a passion for making them better. Whether itâ€™s automating e-commerce workflows, designing efficient systems, or diving into complex coding projects, I enjoy creating solutions that save time, reduce frustration, and make life a little easier.

My journey has taken me from a small town in France to the U.S., with stops in between to learn, adapt, and grow. Along the way, Iâ€™ve earned a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science from Georgia Tech and tackled diverse projects ranging from DevOps pipelines to inventory automation in fast-paced environments.

When Iâ€™m not coding, you might find me climbing, exploring new ideas, or reflecting on how myths and stories shape our lives (yes, Iâ€™m also a bit of a storyteller at heart).
